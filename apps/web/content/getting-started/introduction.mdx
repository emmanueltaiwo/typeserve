# Introduction

TypeServe is the **first and only** tool that generates live mock APIs directly from your TypeScript types. No schema files, no OpenAPI definitions, no manual configuration—just your existing TypeScript interfaces, types, and enums.

## What is TypeServe?

TypeServe automatically creates a fully-functional Express server that generates realistic mock data from your TypeScript types. It's perfect for frontend developers who want to build without waiting for backend endpoints.

## Why TypeServe?

### TypeScript-First Approach

Unlike other mock API tools, TypeServe uses your **existing TypeScript types**. You don't need to:
- Write OpenAPI schemas
- Create JSON Schema files
- Manually define mock data structures
- Maintain separate type definitions

Just use the types you already have in your codebase.

### Lightning Fast

TypeServe parses your types at startup, ensuring all routes are ready before the server starts accepting requests. This initial parsing may take a moment depending on the number of types and project size, but once complete, responses are delivered in **2ms-200ms**. Perfect for rapid development and testing.

### Hot Reload

The server automatically reloads when your types or configuration change. Just save your file and keep coding.

### Smart Data Generation

TypeServe intelligently detects common field patterns:
- **Emails** → `user@example.com`
- **IDs** → UUIDs
- **Dates** → ISO date strings
- **Names** → Full names
- **URLs** → Valid URLs
- **Addresses** → Street addresses

## How It Works

1. **Define your types** in TypeScript files
2. **Create a config** that maps routes to your types
3. **Start the server** with `npx typeserve dev`
4. **Use your API** just like a real backend

That's it! Your mock API is ready to use.

## Use Cases

- **Frontend Development** - Build your UI without waiting for backend endpoints
- **API Design** - Prototype your API structure and share with your team
- **Testing** - Generate consistent mock data for integration tests
- **Demos & Prototypes** - Quickly spin up working APIs for presentations
