# Installation

TypeServe is installed as a development dependency in your project.

## Install with npm

```bash
npm install -D typeserve
```

## Initialize Configuration

After installation, initialize your configuration file:

```bash
npx typeserve init
```

This creates a `typeserve.config.ts` file in your project root with default settings. If the file already exists, you'll be prompted to confirm before overriding.

## Verify Installation

You can verify TypeServe is installed correctly:

```bash
npx typeserve --version
```
