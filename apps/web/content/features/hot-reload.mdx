# Hot Reload

TypeServe watches your files and automatically reloads the server when changes are detected. No manual restarts needed!

## What Triggers Reload

TypeServe automatically reloads when:

1. **Configuration changes** - When `typeserve.config.ts` is modified
2. **Type changes** - When any TypeScript type used in your config changes
3. **Related files** - When files that contain your types are modified

## How It Works

When you save a file, TypeServe detects the change and:

1. Stops the current server
2. Reloads the configuration
3. Re-parses your types (this may take a moment depending on project size)
4. Restarts the server with updated routes

You'll see output like:

```
🔄 File changed: src/types.ts
🔄 Reloading server...
📖 Parsing types...
✅ Types parsed in 37.5s
🚀 Attempting to start your server on port 7002...
✅ TypeServe running on http://localhost:7002/api (started in 37.5s)
📋 Available routes:
   GET /api/users → User[]
✅ Server reloaded in 1m 12.3s
```

The parsing step ensures all type changes are properly reflected in the generated mock data.

## Example Workflow

### 1. Start the Server

```bash
npx typeserve dev
```

```
📖 Loading configuration...
✅ Configuration loaded successfully
📖 Parsing types...
   This may take a while depending on the number of types and project size (est 7.0s).
✅ Types parsed in 1m 1.1s
🚀 Attempting to start your server on port 7002...
✅ TypeServe running on http://localhost:7002/api (started in 1m 1.5s)
📋 Available routes:
   GET /api/users → User
```

### 2. Modify a Type

```typescript
// src/types.ts
export interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  age: number; // ← Add this field
  isActive: boolean; // ← Add this field
}
```

### 3. Save the File

TypeServe automatically detects the change:

```
🔄 File changed: src/types.ts
🔄 Reloading server...
📖 Parsing types...
✅ Types parsed in 37.5s
🚀 Attempting to start your server on port 7002...
✅ TypeServe running on http://localhost:7002/api (started in 37.5s)
📋 Available routes:
   GET /api/users → User[]
✅ Server reloaded in 1m 12.3s
```

### 4. Test the Updated API

```bash
curl http://localhost:7002/api/users
```

The response now includes the new fields:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "...",
    "email": "...",
    "name": "...",
    "age": 28, // ← New field
    "isActive": true // ← New field
  }
]
```

## Adding New Routes

When you add a new route to your config:

```typescript
export default defineMock({
  routes: [
    { path: '/users', method: 'GET', type: 'User[]' },
    { path: '/posts', method: 'GET', type: 'Post[]' }, // ← New route
  ],
});
```

The server reloads and the new route is immediately available:

```
🔄 File changed: src/typeserve.config.ts
🔄 Reloading server...
📖 Parsing types...
✅ Types parsed in 37.5s
🚀 Attempting to start your server on port 7002...
✅ TypeServe running on http://localhost:7002/api (started in 37.5s)
📋 Available routes:
   GET /api/users → User[]
✅ Server reloaded in 1m 12.3s
   GET /api/posts → Post[]  ← New route
```

## File Watching

TypeServe watches:

- Your `typeserve.config.ts` file
- All TypeScript files in your project
- Files that contain types referenced in your config

## Troubleshooting

### Changes Not Detected

If changes aren't being detected:

1. **Check file saving** - Make sure you've saved the file
2. **Check file location** - Ensure files are in watched directories
3. **Restart manually** - Press `Ctrl+C` and restart if needed

### Type Not Found After Change

If you get a "Type not found" warning:

1. **Check exports** - Ensure the type is exported
2. **Check file path** - Verify the file is in the project
3. **Check type name** - Ensure the name matches exactly (case-sensitive)

## Best Practices

### Save Frequently

Save your files frequently to see changes immediately. TypeServe's hot reload makes it easy to iterate quickly.

### Watch the Console

Keep an eye on the console output to see when reloads happen and catch any errors early.

### Test After Changes

After making changes, test your API endpoints to ensure everything works as expected.
